        <h3>Description</h3>
            <p>Overnight oats are a quick and easy breakfast or snack made by soaking rolled oats in liquid overnight.</p>
            <p>This version is as simple as it gets: 5 ingredients, 5 minutes prep time, no fancy methods, and simple ingredients.</p>
            <p><em>Let’s do this!</em></p>
        <h3>Ingredients</h3> 
            <ul>
                <li>1/2 cup unsweetened plain almond milk (or sub other dairy-free milks, such as coconut, soy, or hemp!)</li>
                <li>3/4 Tbsp chia seeds</li>
                <li>2 Tbsp natural salted peanut butter or almond butter (creamy or crunchy // or sub other nut or seed butter)</li>
                <li>1 Tbsp maple syrup (or sub coconut sugar, organic brown sugar, or stevia to taste)</li>
                <li>1/2 cup gluten-free rolled oats (rolled oats are best, vs. steel cut or quick cooking)</li> 
            </ul>
            <p><em>Optional toppings</em></p>
            <ul>
                <li>Sliced banana, strawberries, or raspberries</li>
                <li>Flaxseed meal or additional chia seeds</li>
                <li>Granola</li>
            </ul>
        <h3>Steps</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>To a mason jar or small bowl with a lid, add almond milk, chia seeds, peanut butter, and maple syrup (or other sweetener) and stir with a spoon to combine. The peanut butter doesn’t need to be completely mixed with the almond milk (doing so leaves swirls of peanut butter to enjoy the next day).</li>
                <li>Add oats and stir a few more times. Then press down with a spoon to ensure all oats have been moistened and are immersed in almond milk.</li>
                <li>Cover securely with a lid or seal and set in the refrigerator overnight (or for at least 6 hours) to set/soak.</li>
                <li>The next day, open and enjoy as is or garnish with desired toppings (see options above). See more flavor/topping suggestions in the blog post above!</li>
                <li>Overnight oats will keep in the refrigerator for 2-3 days, though best within the first 12-24 hours in our experience. <strong>Not freezer friendly.</strong></li>
            </ol>
